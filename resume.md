## Summary
I am a System Engineering student at La Universidad de Los Andes and a Computer Science self learner,
currently at 8th semester. I love to solve math-algorithmic interesting problems while learning new
techniques and concepts to improve my problem solving skills. I have a good background on algorithms and
mathematics thanks to extracurricular studying and active participation on programming competitions. I also
enjoy working on challenger projects. That carry me to over pass my skill limits and let me work on
Mammut.io
